fundraising when it suits them. Combining this with a
'first' trigger brings the focus to St Jude for a brief period of time daily, gain donations, and then get back to the normal day content.

The best part is, you as the creator are in control.
Your 'first' could be an elimination in a game, first loss of the day or even the first hour of your stream! And it
doesn't matter what size content creator you are.
Whether you stream to 10 or 100 people you can set the 'first' donation amount to whatever you think works within your community.

  "description": "St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital is leading the way the world understands, treats and defeats childhood cancer and other life-threatening diseases. Our mission is clear: Finding cures. Saving children.®

Families never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, housing or food – so they can focus on helping their child live.

Treatments invented at St. Jude have helped increase the overall childhood cancer survival rate from 20% to more than 80% since we opened more than 60 years ago. We won’t stop until no child dies from cancer.

St. Jude shares the breakthroughs it makes, and every child saved at St. Jude means doctors and scientists worldwide can use that knowledge to save thousands more children.
